		<paramain>Probably the most exclusive and strikingly enhanced transformation of a flagship by HTC. It is being truly noted as the sibling of metallic M8. Apart from the ultrapixel camera which has been replaced in the E8 by a 13MP camera and the polycarbonate body, it is pretty much the same.</paramain>

			<fullpara2><![CDATA[<p class="subheadingofarticle">Camera and Sound:</p><br/><br/>13MP is quiet common figure in today’s mobile phone segment. The other more reliable criteria for the comparison of the camera stength is PPI( pixels per inch).

The camera comes with an excellent HDR mode resulting in a wonderful photography experience in certain situations.<br/><br/>Its exclusive Boomsound speakers are an enthralling feature of its design structure. Moreover these front facing speakers add to listening experience to the user. It has become a select design trait for HTC smartphones now.]]></fullpara2>

Though, promised to release the Lollipop update within 90 days of the Google release, for E8 it is still hanging on the line.]]></fullpara3>

The theme and background score of the video are customizable. But this feature is limited upto 16 images only. <br/><br/>Scribble is a note taking app with a striking variety of templates.<br/><br/>As far as longetivity of usage is concerned, the 2600MAh battery works very easily throughout the day with heavy 3G usage. Although E8 has a slightly concerning heating issue at times of regular usage or during charging.<br/><br/>Additionally, the gesture controls are exceptionally handy to use. Double Tap to wake and Swipe features can be an enriching experience for the user. ]]></fullpara4>
